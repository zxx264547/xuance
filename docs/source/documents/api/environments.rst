Environments
======================

The software includes single agent task simulation environments such as Atari, Mujoco, Classic Control, and Box2D under gym.
It also includes multi-agent task simulation environments such as MPE and SISL under the open-source environment PettingZoo, StarCraft2, MAgent2, Google Football, etc.
Each simulation environment contains a rich variety of task scenarios, as shown in the table below.
