Agents
======================

XuanCe currently supports various types of DRL agents, such as value-based, policy-based, and MARL-based agents. 
These agents can deal with both continuous and discrete actions. The MARL algorithms can deal with both cooperative and competitve tasks. 
All of the agents in XuanCe are implemented under a unified framework, which are supported by PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. 
The class of agents are listed as follows.
